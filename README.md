# so_long

## Introduction

*This project is a small 2D game with minilibx. You'll learn about textures, sprites and tiles.*

## Objectives

Itâ€™s time for you to create a basic computer graphics project!
so long will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window management,
event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.
You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was
developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images
and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
The other goals are similar to every other goal for this first year: being rigorous, level
up in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so forth.

## Instructions

- Clone this repo;
- CD into it;
- run `make minilibx` to download minilibx;
- run `make`;
- run the executable followed by a valid .ber map, for example:
- `./so_long maps/example.ber`
- Get Ziva to eat her burgers using WASD, and get her to the exit afterwards.

Here is a preview of my game:

If you are currently working on this project, I would recommend the following tools:

[Minilibx "Starter Pack"](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html) - useful "guide" on how to use minilibx;

[so_long_invalidator](https://github.com/Nuno-Jesus/so_long_invalidator) by [Nuno-Jesus](https://github.com/Nuno-Jesus) - so_long tester that will help you figure out if you are correctly handling possible errors on map validation.
